# This code categorizes a person's age into different groups.
# It checks if the age is less than 13, between 13 and 19, between 20 and 59, or 60 and above.
# The code takes an age input from the user and categorizes them into child, teenager, adult, or senior citizen based on their age.
# The code uses if-elif-else statements to determine the age category.
# The code is complete and does not require any changes.
